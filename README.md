 Hackathon 3 Journey
Day 1: Laying the Foundation for Your Marketplace Journey
On the first day, I planned how to start building my project and outlined the steps to proceed.

Day 2: Technical Approach
On the second day, I worked on the technical aspects of the project. I created a three-step plan:

Front-End
Database (Schema)
APIs
Day 3: API Integration & Data Migration
On the third day, I integrated APIs into my project and migrated data to Sanity.

Day 4: Building Dynamic Front-End Components
On the fourth day, I focused on creating dynamic front-end components to make the website more appealing and user-friendly.

Day 5: Testing & Error Handling
On the fifth day, I tested the website to ensure responsiveness and performance, and I resolved any errors that arose.

Day 6: Deployment & Environmental Setup
On the sixth day, I prepared the project for deployment and ensured the environment was properly configured.

Day 7: Live Deployment & Post-Launch
On the final day, I successfully deployed the project and submitted it.



This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
